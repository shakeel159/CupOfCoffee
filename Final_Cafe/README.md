# Final

Your final is to design a coffee maker using OOP semantics

Your coffee maker must have

- A hopper to store beans
- A Heat Source
- A Water Reservoir
- A grinder
- A Cup Receptacle

The rules of your system

- A hopper can hold at most 200 grams of beans
- Each cup of coffee takes 50 grams of beans to maker
- The Water Reservoir Can Hold 1 Liter of Water
- Each cup of coffee takes .25 liters to make
- Water enters the reservoir at 30 degrees Celsius
- To brew coffee the water needs to be at 100 degrees Celsius
- A user should be able to request n cups of coffee where n > 0 and n <= 4
- you must print out every step of the process
- this is an OOP assignment, use objects
- I should be able to build your project with `make`
